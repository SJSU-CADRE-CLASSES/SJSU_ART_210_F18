Classroom Protocol
==================

Participation
-------------

•	Participation in class discussions for readings, material that we watch in class, giving feedback to your peers on their work is mandatory. Remember that 20% of your grade is based on your participation in class + topic presentation and you are expected to actively participate in such discourses as they are some of the most important sections of our class.

•	On Presentation days you must be able to explain and give a clear presentation of the topic, research, and concepts. If you have a hard time talking in front of a crowd or remembering your points, use a notebook, powerpoint, sketches or bullet points for your presentations.

•	For readings that I will be assigning in this course you are required to post your reading response (500 word two pages double spaced) response to our class blog. You are asked to think critically and post something that questions, criticizes, endorses, and/or adds to the reading. See the course outline chart for deadlines for these responses.

Grading Policy
--------------

**Seminar Participation and Discussion = 10% + 10%**

It is required that you attend and participate regularly in seminar discussion, this will account for 10% of your grade. The course includes engaged group dialogue and student-lead presentations of the assigned readings along with visual material. The student-lead presentations will be assigned at the beginning of the semester and your presentation and preparedness will account for an additional 10% of your grade. Students will be assessed based upon their individual level of engagement in seminar and the quality of student-lead presentations as defined in the grading policy/ rubric below. 

**Studio Visit and work presentation = 20%**

Throughout the course of the semester students will be asked to present their current work to the seminar as an open studio visit. Students are responsible for presenting their work in a professional manner.

**Professional Practice = 20%**

Throughout the semester students will need to engage with the professional art community. This can take the form of applications to professional conferences, SWITCH Journal participation, or art exibitions.

**Final Research and Art Project = 40%** 

Final papers and research projects must demonstrate comprehension of, and engagement with, at least two of the primary seminar themes and topics. Research leading to the final presentation will begin in early November.
